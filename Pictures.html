            <p id="halfcoltext">Here is what Project Limekist looked like when we first got her.
                She definitely had an old school look to her. A lot has changed since then...
                <br>
                Notice the rims, the grill area, and the ride height of the car!
                <br>
                Keep these things in mind as you look through the pictures. You will notice many
                changes.

            <p id="halfcoltext">Limekist has seen a lot of upgrades. The car turned into quite the project.
                Mel and Brian Silva helped with Project Limekist. They each have Firebirds 
                of their own.
                <br>
                This has been a long process, but it has been very memorable and enjoyable.

            <p id="halfcoltext">The engine rebuild process was a very interesting one. Pete is a great local machinist
                that we chose to work with.
                We have learned a lot about V-8s throughout this process. Pontiac 350 HP on the way.
                <br>
                Notice the new, period correct paint. This engine is going to be awesome!

            <p id="halfcoltext">Project Limekist is almost finished!! This process has been an unforgettable one. We will
                soon have a running and driving 1971 Pontiac Firebird Formula 350 with a numbers matching 
                powertrain! My dad Sergio is very excited to drive his rebuilt hot rod all over 
                California now! <b>Well maybe...</b>
                <br>
                A special thanks to all those who helped on this project to make this moment possible!

            <p id="halfcoltext">Ethan picked up this 1971 Charger with a numbers matching 318 engine and 904 transmission.
                The car needs a lot of work, but it has potential. Another green 1971 muscle car in the 
                family! MOPAR BABY!
                <br>
                We have started purchasing parts for this car. The process is just beginning. 
                <br> 
                A special thanks to AW & DW for letting me store my car in their garage.
