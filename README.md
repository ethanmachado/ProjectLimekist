Project Limekist is a passion project of mine. 

It is a website that focuses on the restoration/preservation of a 1971 Pontiac Firebird Formula 350.

This is my first website that I have published, and it took a lot of lines of code to complete. 

It is not the best website, but the site is very meaningful and important to me.

That is why I published it using Github Pages. 

It is a combination of HTML and CSS. 

Please enjoy viewing my website, and if you have any questions please contact that email that is 
listed on the website.

Thank you,

Ethan Machado
