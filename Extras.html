                <p id="ES">Hello, My name is Ethan Machado, and I am the creator of this website. I am a college student 
                    studying computer science and I have a passion for muscle cars. I decided to create this website 
                    because I wanted to document the progress on Project Limekist while also practicing my technical skills.
                </p>
                    <hr>
                <p id="ES">Sergio Machado is the owner of Project Limekist. He has worked hard to get his Firebird almost ready to
                    run and drive anywhere. He has learned a lot about muscle cars while working on his project. The second
                    generation firebird is his favorite muscle car.
                </p>
                    <hr>
                <p id="ES">Overall, this has been a great experience and we would strongly recommened it to anyone who would like to
                    get into the hot rod culture. Just remember to spend wisely and build your car within reason if you are 
                    not made out of money.
