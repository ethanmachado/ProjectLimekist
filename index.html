            <p>Project Limekist features a 1971 Firebird Formula that is Limekist green with black interior. 
                The car was fitted with the Formula 350 package, which was a rare option considering the fact that 
                more people opted for the Formula 400 package. The car was found in the San Jose Area in 2014, and it 
                had been sitting in a yard for years. Limekist had the Formula package (with the fantastic Formula Hood) 
                and offered a great starting point for a restomod project. This website details the changes made with pictures
                and contains a list of part websites used for those who are looking to do something similiar with their Firebird.

            <p>The second generation Firebird Formula hood is one of the greatest hoods ever created during the muscle car 
                era. It really makes the car stand out amongst the others. The dual hood scoops give the car an aggressive 
                look. Overall, the second generation Firebird has a timeless design that stands as one of General Motors' 
                best during the muscle car era.
